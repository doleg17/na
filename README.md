This tool can be used in three different ways that are covered in the following secctions. 
- Import as a package to your existing python script.

## Use cases
## 1. Package import

```python
# my_script.py

from ml_ab_parser import convert

input_file = 'ML_AB'
output_file = 'output.extxyz'

convert(input_file, output_file)
```

This code will read data from ```ML_AB```, convert it and save into ```output.extxyz```.
